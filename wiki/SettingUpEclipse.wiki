#summary How to set up an eclipse project for neutrino development.

The antineutrino source is an eclipse project so if you have CDT (for C/C++ development) installed just checking it out using eclipse sets it up correctly as a C++ project.

To build you have to specify which scons to use by setting the `SCONS` variable.
   * Open Window > Preferences ...
   * Under C/C++ > CDT build variables add a variable with the name `SCONS` and whose value is the command to run scons.  If you have a sane installation this will just be `scons`.
   * Try building.  If this doesn't work then restarting eclipse should do the trick.

With the setup that comes with the antineutrino project eclipse will rebuild whenever a file is saved.  If you have a reasonably modern machine this should never be a problem.
