#summary The code style
#labels Development

The code style used is based on K&R but with:

   * Indentation 2 spaces
   * Always spaces, never tabs
   * Lines should, if possible, be no longer than 70-80 characters

The naming conventions are slightly unusual (but for good reason)

   * Variables are lower_case_with_underscores
   * Classes are UpperCamelCase except for dumb utility classes (like `list`, `vector` and such) which are lower_case_with_underscores.
   * Constants are kUpperCamelCase starting with a lower case 'k' (for _konstant_ I suppose).
   * Enumerations are also xxUpperCamelCase, starting with a one or two lower case character prefix.  No two enums share the same prefix.
   * Most `#define`s are in UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.  The exception is the higher-order enumerator macros that take another macro as an argument and invoke it for each element in a list.  They are in eUpperCamelCase starting with a lower case 'e' (for _enumerator_).
