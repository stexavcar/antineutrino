#summary How to run neutrino.

= The easy way =

Ensure that you have ant and junit installed.  Check out the source code.  Run

{{{
ant test
}}}

This will compile the java code, compile the neutrino libraries and tests into a PIB (`.pib`) file and run the tests.  The tests are quite chatty because that's currently the only way to ensure that they are actually all run.

= The flexible way =

Compile neutrino somehow, possibly using the ant script.  Compile the neutrino libraries and tests into a PIB,

{{{
./scripts/compile.sh --classpath <classes> --root-path lib --outfile <pibfile>
}}}

You can then inspect the PIB by doing

{{{
./scripts/dump.sh <pibfile>
}}}

Add the `-n` option to see the raw contents, otherwise you will see the fully grown object.  Finally, you can run a PIB using

{{{
./scripts/run.sh --classpath <classes> --pib-path <pibfile> --entry-point <name>
}}}

The entry point for running the tests is `test`.

To profile any of these steps add the `--hprof` option to the command.
